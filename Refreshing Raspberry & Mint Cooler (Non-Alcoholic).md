# Refreshing Raspberry & Mint Cooler (Non-Alcoholic)

This drink is perfect for a hot summer day - it's sweet, tart, refreshing, and beautifully colored!

**Yields:** 2 servings  
**Prep time:** 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup fresh raspberries (plus a few extra for garnish)
- 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves (plus a sprig for garnish)
- 1/4 cup simple syrup (or to taste - see instructions below)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1 cup sparkling water or club soda, chilled
- Ice cubes
- Optional: A few slices of cucumber for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Muddle the Flavor:** In a sturdy glass or a cocktail shaker, combine the raspberries and mint leaves. Gently muddle them together with a muddler or the back of a wooden spoon. You want to bruise the raspberries and mint to release their flavors, but don't mash them completely.

2. **Add Sweetness & Tartness:** Add the simple syrup and lime juice to the muddled mixture. Stir well to combine.

3. **Simple Syrup (Optional but Recommended):** If you don't have simple syrup, you can make it quickly. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let it cool completely before using.

4. **Strain (Optional, but recommended):** If you prefer a smoother drink, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher or directly into two glasses. This will remove the raspberry seeds and any large mint pieces. If you don't mind the seeds, you can skip this step.

5. **Assemble the Drinks:** Fill two glasses with ice cubes.

6. **Pour and Top:** Divide the raspberry-mint mixture evenly between the two glasses. Top each glass with chilled sparkling water or club soda.

7. **Garnish & Enjoy!** Stir gently. Garnish each glass with a few fresh raspberries, a sprig of mint, and optionally a slice of cucumber. Serve immediately and enjoy!

## Tips and Variations

### Sweetness Adjustments
- **Adjust Sweetness:** Taste the drink and adjust the amount of simple syrup to your liking. If your raspberries are very sweet, you might need less.

### Ingredient Substitutions
- **Frozen Raspberries:** You can use frozen raspberries. Let them thaw slightly before muddling.
- **Other Berries:** Try other berries like strawberries or blueberries instead of raspberries.
- **Different Herbs:** Experiment with other herbs like basil or lemon verbena.

### Flavor Variations
- **Fruity Twist:** Add a splash of pineapple juice or orange juice for extra flavor.
- **Extra Fizz:** Use tonic water instead of sparkling water for a slightly bitter twist. (Tonic water contains quinine, which is bitter).

### Serving Options
- **Make a Pitcher:** Double or triple the recipe for a crowd!
