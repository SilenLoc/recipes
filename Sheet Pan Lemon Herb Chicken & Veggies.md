# Easy & Healthy: Sheet Pan Lemon Herb Chicken & Veggies

This meal is quick to prep, cooks in one pan (easy cleanup!), and is packed with flavor and nutrients.

## Ingredients:

**Protein:**
* 450g boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs (cut into 2.5cm pieces)

**Veggies:**
* 1 large bell pepper (any color), chopped
* 1 medium zucchini, chopped
* 1 red onion, cut into wedges
* 250ml broccoli florets

**Flavor:**
* 30ml olive oil
* 1 lemon, zested and juiced
* 5ml dried oregano
* 5ml dried thyme
* 2.5ml garlic powder
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:

1. **Prep the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 200°C.

2. **Chop the Veggies:** Chop all your veggies and place them in a large bowl.

3. **Season the Chicken:** In the same bowl with the veggies, add the chicken pieces.

4. **Make the Dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest and juice, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

5. **Combine and Toss:** Pour the dressing over the chicken and veggies. Toss everything well to ensure it's evenly coated.

6. **Spread on Sheet Pan:** Spread the chicken and veggies in a single layer on a large baking sheet.

7. **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature of 74°C) and the vegetables are tender.

8. **Serve:** Serve immediately!

## Tips & Variations:

* **Add Carbs:** Serve over a bed of cooked quinoa, brown rice, or whole-wheat pasta for a more filling meal.
* **Spice it Up:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat.
* **Other Veggie Options:** Feel free to swap in other veggies like asparagus, sweet potatoes (chopped small), or Brussels sprouts.
* **Marinate (Optional):** For extra flavor, you can marinate the chicken in the lemon herb mixture for 30 minutes before baking.

Enjoy your delicious and healthy meal!
