## Ingredients

### For the Salmon:
* 2 (4-6 oz) salmon fillets, skin on or off (your preference)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (or a mix of oregano, basil, thyme)
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* Lemon slices (for garnish, optional)
* Fresh parsley or dill (for garnish, optional)

### For the Roasted Asparagus:
* 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Cauliflower Rice:
* 1 medium head of cauliflower, riced (you can buy it pre-riced for convenience!)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil or avocado oil
* 1/4 cup chopped onion
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* Optional: pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat

## Instructions

**1. Preheat & Prep:**
* Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

**2. Prepare the Salmon:**
* Place the salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet.
* Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice.
* Sprinkle with Italian herbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
* If desired, place a few lemon slices on top of the salmon.

**3. Roast the Asparagus:**
* In a bowl, toss the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
* Spread the asparagus on the same baking sheet (or a separate one if it's crowded).

**4. Roast Everything Together:**
* Place the baking sheet (with salmon and asparagus) in the preheated oven.
* Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, and the asparagus is tender-crisp. Cooking time will vary based on the thickness of the salmon. Asparagus will take about 15-20 minutes.

**5. Make the Cauliflower Rice:**
* While the salmon and asparagus are baking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
* Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-5 minutes.
* Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.
* Add the riced cauliflower and cook, stirring frequently, for 5-7 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender and slightly browned.
* Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using).

**6. Assemble & Serve:**
* Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
* Divide the cauliflower rice between two plates.
* Top with the roasted asparagus and salmon fillets.
* Garnish with fresh parsley or dill (optional) and a lemon wedge (optional).
