Yields: 6 servings
Prep time: 20 minutes
Cook time: 10 minutes (for pasta)
Ingredients
Pasta

8 oz whole-wheat pasta (rotini, farfalle, or penne work well)

Vegetables

1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cucumber, diced
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced (optional, can sub with green onion)
1 cup broccoli florets, blanched for 2 minutes (optional)
1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved (optional)

Protein

6 oz grilled chicken breast, cooked and diced (or can of chickpeas, drained & rinsed, or 8 oz cooked shrimp)
4 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese balls (small, or cubed)

Dressing

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (or a mix of oregano, basil, and thyme)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Instructions

Cook the Pasta: Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain well and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. This prevents overcooking and sticking.
Prepare the Vegetables: While the pasta is cooking, prepare the vegetables by dicing, slicing, or halving them as indicated in the ingredients list. Blanch the broccoli if using (place florets in boiling water for 2 minutes, then immediately transfer to ice water).
Make the Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper until emulsified (smooth and combined).
Assemble the Salad: In a large bowl, combine the cooked pasta, prepared vegetables, and protein.
Dress the Salad: Pour the dressing over the pasta salad and toss gently to combine, making sure everything is evenly coated.
Add Cheese: Gently fold in the mozzarella cheese balls.
Chill and Serve: Cover the pasta salad and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. This also allows the dressing to be absorbed by the pasta. Serve chilled.

Tips & Variations
Spice Options

Add a little heat: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the dressing.
Spice it up: Add a jalape√±o pepper, seeded and minced.

Protein Alternatives

Add more protein: Tuna or salmon (canned in water, drained) are great options.

Dressing Variations

Add a creamy element (lighter version): Whisk in a tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt or light mayonnaise to the dressing.

Dietary Modifications

Make it vegan: Omit the cheese and chicken/shrimp. Substitute with extra chickpeas, or can add sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and toasted nuts or seeds.
Use different cheeses: Feta or crumbled goat cheese work well, but are higher in sodium.

Additional Toppings

Add some nuts or seeds: Toasted pine nuts or sunflower seeds add a nice crunch and healthy fats.

Storage

Meal Prep: This salad is great for meal prepping! Store in individual containers for easy lunches or dinners.
